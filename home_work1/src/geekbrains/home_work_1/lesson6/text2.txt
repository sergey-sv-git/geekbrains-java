Maybe, it's too late or, maybe, early,
 It has not occurred to me for years,
 I resemble now Don Juan, really,
 Like a proper flippant man of verse.

 What"s the matter? What has happened, really?
 Every day I have some other chick.
 And I lose self-pity, willy-nilly,
 And defy unfaithfulness and trick.

 I have always kept my heart from simple,
 Tender feelings,   and I wonder what
 I am looking for in oh, so cripple
 Women, so light-headed, and so void.

 Hold me back, restrain me, scornful feeling,
 I have always been marked up by you.
 In my heart I have a chilly  steaming
 And the rustle of lilac of blue.

 In my heart I have a lemon sunset,
 Through the fog I hear  someone say:
 For your freedom you will have to answer,
 Well, Don Juan, take the challenge, eh?

 As I take the challenge within reason,
 I  can see the same old thing I have:
 I must take a storm for  blooming  season
 And mistake a thrill for real love.

 That"s the reason That"s the way it happened.
 Every day I  have some other chick,
 So that I might always smile, be  happy
 And defy unfaithfulness and trick.
